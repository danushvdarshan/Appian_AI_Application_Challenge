# Appian_AI_Application_Challenge
# Just-in-Time Intelligent Knowledge Retrieval for Appian

This project demonstrates a conceptual prototype of a context-aware
knowledge retrieval system for Appian case management.

## Problem
Support agents must search across multiple policy documents while
handling high-stakes cases, leading to delays and compliance risks.

## Solution
A Just-in-Time AI assistant that:
- Reads active case context (claim type, state)
- Retrieves relevant policy text
- Displays answers with verifiable citations

## Architecture
1. Case Context Input
2. Semantic Retrieval (simulated)
3. Grounded Answer Generation
4. Source Citation Display

## Tech Stack (Prototype)
- Python
- Streamlit (UI)
- Rule-based retrieval (simulating RAG)

## Note
This is a lightweight prototype intended to demonstrate system behavior
and user experience rather than production-scale ML performance.
